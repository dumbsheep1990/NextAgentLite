## 🧪 AI Evaluation Validation

To validate the system's actual effectiveness, we had multiple mainstream large language models participate in the "HuoZiGe" low-code platform certification exams. The evaluation used three modes: direct answer generation, knowledge base retrieval (GC-QA-RAG), and Agent automatic planning retrieval (based on GC-QA-RAG).

## 🚀 Quick Start

We strongly recommend using Docker for one-click deployment - this is the fastest way to experience this project.

**⚠️ Important Note**: You must configure API keys before deployment, otherwise the system won't work properly! If keys change, restart the service.

### 🐳 Docker One-click Deployment (Recommended)

Ensure your machine has `Docker` and `Docker Compose` installed.

**Step 1: Get API Keys**

You need to prepare the following API keys:

-   **Large Language Model API**: We recommend [Alibaba Cloud Platform](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/) or [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/)
-   **Embedding Model API**: We recommend using Alibaba Cloud Qwen's embedding model

**Step 2: Configuration and Deployment**

Knowledge base deployment:

```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/GrapeCity-AI/gc-qa-rag.git
cd gc-qa-rag

# 2. Configure API keys (Required!)
# Edit sources/gc-qa-rag-etl/.config.production.json
# Edit sources/gc-qa-rag-server/.config.production.json
# Fill in your API keys

# 3. Enter deployment directory
cd sources/gc-qa-rag-server/deploy

# 4. Start all services
docker compose up -d --build
```

ETL management backend deployment:

```bash
# 1. Enter ETL directory
cd sources/gc-qa-rag-etl

# 2. Start all services
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Step 3: Upload Data and Start Using**

1. **Access ETL Management Backend**: `http://localhost:8001`

    - Upload your PDF, Word, Markdown and other documents
    - Wait for system processing and Q&A pair generation
    - Publish data to knowledge base

2. **Access RAG Q&A Homepage**: `http://localhost:80`
    - Start asking questions based on your uploaded document content
    - Enjoy the intelligent Q&A experience!

**Complete Operation Flow**:

```
Prepare API Keys → Configure System → Docker Deploy → Upload Documents → ETL Process → Publish Data → Frontend Test → Start Using
```

For more detailed deployment guide, please refer to [Docker Deployment Tutorial](https://grapecity-ai.github.io/gc-qa-rag/en/2-development-tutorial/1-docker-deployment/)

### 🔧 Manual Deployment

If you want to understand the details of each module or perform secondary development, you can choose manual deployment.

**Environment Dependencies:**

-   Python 3.13+ (with PDM)
-   Node.js 16+ (with pnpm)
-   MySQL
-   Qdrant

### 📋 Configuration Instructions

When using official Docker images, you need to configure environment variables in the docker-compose.dockerhub.yml file to pass them to containers. The system supports flexible configuration priority:

**Configuration Priority**: `.saved.json files` > `Docker environment variables` > `.env files` > `JSON config files` > `default values`

-   **`.saved.json files`**: Dynamically generated when modifying configuration through the frontend interface, highest priority, ensuring user-modified configurations take effect
-   **Docker environment variables**: Suitable for production deployment, set through docker-compose files
-   **`.env files`**: Suitable for development environments, storing sensitive information like API keys
-   **JSON config files**: Base configuration templates, supporting complex nested configuration structures

**For complete environment variable lists, see:**

-   RAG Service: [`sources/gc-qa-rag-server/env.example`](./sources/gc-qa-rag-server/env.example)
-   ETL Service: [`sources/gc-qa-rag-etl/env.example`](./sources/gc-qa-rag-etl/env.example)

**Important**: Regardless of which deployment method you choose, you need to configure API keys first!

For detailed steps, please refer to our [Quick Start Guide](./quickstart_ENGLISH.md).

## 💡 Core Philosophy: Why Choose Advanced QA Pre-generation?

Traditional RAG systems heavily rely on the quality of document "chunking". However, simple text segmentation methods often encounter **context distortion**, **semantic ambiguity**, and **version conflicts** when processing complex enterprise documents, leading to poor retrieval performance.

We initially tried the intuitive "full-text feeding" approach - feeding entire documents directly to large models to generate Q&A pairs. But practice proved this path is full of pitfalls:

-   **For short documents**: Models lack sufficient context and tend to "over-associate," fabricating information that doesn't exist in the original text.
-   **For long documents**: Models have an "attention ceiling" and often can only generate 10-15 Q&A pairs, causing massive knowledge point omissions or generating repetitive, generalized content.

To fundamentally solve these problems, we abandoned crude text chunking and designed an **adaptive, multi-stage advanced QA pre-generation system**. The core idea is: **shifting from "cutting text" to "precisely extracting knowledge points"**.

This system achieves this mainly through the following innovative mechanisms:

#### 1. Dynamic Adaptive Processing Strategy

Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, we dynamically adjust strategies based on document length:

-   **Short Documents - Sentence-level Precise Control**: We assume "one sentence corresponds to one knowledge point" and dynamically instruct the model to generate equivalent Q&A pairs by calculating sentence count, eliminating information fabrication and ensuring content fidelity to the original text.
-   **Long Documents - Two-stage Memory-Focus Mechanism**: We created this conversational generation method.
    -   **Stage 1 (Memory)**: Let the large model "remember" the full text, building complete contextual background (long-term memory).
    -   **Stage 2 (Focus)**: Question each segment individually, guiding the model to "focus" on local details for precise Q&A extraction (short-term attention).
        This mechanism perfectly solves information coverage and generation quality issues for long documents.

#### 2. Beyond Q&A: Generating High-value Derivative Data

The "advanced" aspect goes beyond this. While generating core Q&A pairs, the system also intelligently derives three types of high-value data, storing them all in the vector database to greatly enhance the RAG system's comprehensive capabilities:

-   **① Summary**: Generates summaries for each knowledge point, improving contextual understanding during generation and helping large models recommend relevant documents to users.
-   **② Full Answer**: Generates more detailed answers for key questions, used for frontend "expand more" features or as rich materials for answer generation.
-   **③ Question Variants**: Generates multiple similar phrasings for each question, significantly improving recall rates for diverse user questions.

#### 3. Engineering Robustness Design

We built complete engineering safeguards for this system, including: automated document parsing, automatic sentence segmentation for Chinese, flexible text grouping, and most critically, **multiple fault-tolerant JSON parsing mechanisms** (from standard extraction to forced conversion to regex matching), ensuring nearly 100% generation success rate in production environments (failures are usually due to content compliance mechanisms).

**In summary, GC-QA-RAG's core philosophy is: by simulating human "memory-focus" learning patterns and precise engineering design, intelligently transforming unstructured documents into structured, multi-dimensional high-quality knowledge bases, laying a solid foundation for downstream precise retrieval and high-quality answers.**

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

This system adopts a modular design with three core layers:

1. **Construction Layer (ETL)**: Responsible for extracting information from various data sources (documents, web pages, forums), building high-quality knowledge bases through **QA generation** and **vectorization**.
2. **Retrieval Layer (Retrieval)**: Receives user queries and efficiently, precisely recalls the most relevant information from the knowledge base through **query rewriting**, **hybrid retrieval**, and **RRF ranking**.
3. **Generation Layer (Generation)**: Integrates retrieved information and uses Large Language Models (LLM) to generate final fluent, accurate answers, supporting multi-turn conversations.
